            <h1>Planets in the Universe</h1>
            <p>
                The universe consists of solar system, stars, galaxies and so many other elements. 
            <br>
                The solar system has the sun at centre, and all the planets are revolving around it in the elliptical 
                orbits.

                    <li>Its mean diameter is 4,880 km.</li>
                    <li>It may appear as a bright star. </li>
                    <li>It was called as a morning star and an evening star because of its apparitions.</li>

                    <li>
                        Its surface was shaped by impact cratering, which is when objects (like comets or meteoroids) from

                        Although it is the closest planet to the sun, it is not the hottest planet of solar system. Its

                <h2>Venus</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is the second planet of the solar system which is next to mercury.</li>
                    <li>It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.</li>
                    <li>It is the brightest planet of the solar system.</li>
                    <li>Its mean diameter is 12,100 km.</li>  
                    <li>It can be seen with naked eye.</li>
                    <li>Atmosphere on Venus contains 95% of carbon-dioxide.</li>
                    <li>This planet is also called earth's sister because it is similar to Earth in size and mass.</li>
                    <li>There is no possiblity of life on this planet.</li>                                      
                    <li>
                        It takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the solar system with the 
                        revolution period of 243 Earth days. In other words, a day on Venus is longer than a year.
                    </li>
                    <li>Unlike the other planets, Venus spins clockwise on its axis.</li>
                    <li>It does not have any moons or satellites.</li>
                    <li>
                        It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for writers 
                        and poets as the "morning star" and the "evening star".
                    </li>
                    <li>Much of the Venusian surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity.</li>
                    <li>
                        Despite Venus is not closest to the sun, it has the highest temperature reaches 471&deg;Celsius.
                    </li>
                    <li>It reflects 70% of all the sunlight it receives. Therefore, it shines so brightly.</li>

                        At a height of 30 to 50 km from the surface of earth, a layer called ozone layers is present. It 
                        is also called ozone blanket.

                    <li>
                        It is reddish planet of solar system, because it is covered with red dust causing the atmosphere

                    <li>Next to Mars, Jupiter is the fifth planet.</li>
                    <li>It is named after the Roman god of sky and thunder.</li>
                    <li>It is the heaviest and the biggest planet of solar system.</li>

                        It has a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a 
                        well-defined solid surface.

                        Its upper atmosphere is about 88-92% hydrogen and 8-12% helium by percent volume of gas molecules.
                    </li>
                    <li>Its mass is 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the solar system.</li>
                    <li>
                        The temperature and pressure inside Jupiter increase steadily inward, due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz 
                        mechanism.
                    </li>
                    <li>It has the largest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System (5,000 km in altitude).</li>
                    <li>Its magnetic field is fourteen times as strong as that of Earth.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Next to Jupiter, Saturn is the sixth planet.</li>
                    <li>It is named after the Roman god of agriculture and harvest.</li>
                    <li>It is the second biggest and heaviest planet of solar system.</li>
                    <li>Its mean diameter is 1,20,536 kms.</li>
                    <li>It can be seen with naked eye.</li> 
                    <li>Life is not possible on this planet.</li>                    
                    <li>
                        It has beautiful rings which are made up of ice, rocks and dust. They can be seen even with 
                        an inexpensive telescope.
                    </li>                    
                    <li>It is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture.</li>
                    <li>It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth.</li>
                    <li>It is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water - about 30% less.</li>
                    <li>It could float in water because it is mostly made of gas.</li>
                    <li>The outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium by volume.</li>
                    <li>It has an intrinsic magnetic field that has a simple, symmetric shape - a magnetic dipole.</li>
                    <li>
                        It has 82 moons. Its <ins>Titan</ins> moon has a significant atmosphere (that is denser than any 
                        of the terrestrial planets except Venus) as compared to other moons in the solar system.

                <ul>
                    <li>This seventh planet is next to Saturn.</li>
                    <li>It is named after the Greek god of the sky.</li>
                    <li>Its mean diameter is 51,000 km.</li>
                    <li>It cannot be seen with naked eye.</li>
                    <li>This planet rotates on its axis from east to west.</li>
                    <li>
                        It is covered with thick layer of beautiful blue and green gases as a result of the methane in its 
                        mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is composed of rocks and various ices.</li>
                    <li>
                        It has bands of clouds that blow around it rapidly. But they are extremely faint, visible only with 
                        radical image enhancement.
                    </li>                    
                    <li>It has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons.</li>
                    <li>
                        Its structure consists of three layers: a rocky core in the centre, an icy mantle in the middle and 
                        an outer gaseous hydrogen/helium envelope.
                    </li>
                    <li>It hits the coldest temperatures of any planet (about -224&deg;Celsius).</li>
                    <li>It has 27 natural satellites.</li>
                    <li>One rotation on Uranus takes about 17 hours.</li>
                    <li>
                        The summer season on Uranus is two decades of non-stop sunlight, and the winter season has also the 
                        same time interval in total darkness.

                    <li>It is named after the Roman god of sea.</li>
                    <li>Its diameter is 49,528 km.</li>
                    <li>
                        It can not be seen with naked eye; however, it can be seen with binoculars (but a large telescope 
                        is needed to see anything other than a tiny disk).
                    </li>

                    <li>The core of Neptune is likely composed of iron, nickel and silicates.</li>
                    <li>
                        Its atmosphere is divided into two main regions: the lower troposphere, where temperature decreases
                        with altitude, and the stratosphere, where temperature increases with altitude.
                    </li>
                    <li>It has 14 moons.<ins>Triton</ins> is the largest Neptunian moon.</li>
                    <li>It has planetary ring system.</li>
                    <li>It is the smallest gas and ice giants.</li>
                    <li>It has 6 faint rings.</li>
                    <li>
                        The atmosphere of Neptune is made of hydrogen and helium, with some methane. These components give 
                        Neptune blue color.
